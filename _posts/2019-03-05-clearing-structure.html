title: "editing echoserver #1 - structure problem"
---
<p>
    I started clearing the class structure in the echoserver code. But it is very difficult because I'm not sure some decisions are right or not at the time I decide.
</p>
<p>
    So...I first thought that session should be independent. But I had no idea whether the structure and role of session class are right or not. At that time I thought, "if session could be replaced by the mock object, that's right."
</p>
<p>
    So now I downloaded the Catch2 - unittest framework framework for C++ - and am attaching the Catch2 header files to the project.
</p>
<p>
    I'll spend much time to adapt unittest to the project, but I'm studying! I'll do my best - although it's a part-time study? haha - and make it good.
