title: "editing echoserver #2 - unittest in vs with gtest?"
---
<p>
    After decided adding unittest to echoserver - to find whether it is a good design structure or not, I created a unittest project with Visual Studio 2017.
</p>
<p>
    And I was surprised that VS 2017 supports google test?! What a wonderful world...Using google test in Microsoft VS...haha.
</p>
<p>
    So now I created google unittest and am trying to make the structure better. I expect that I can make my project public soon.
