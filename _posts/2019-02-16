title: "Start editing echoserver"
---
<p>
I started editing a simple echoserver that I wrote with boost asio.
</p>
<p>
I first wrote a server code with minimal functions, but now I think that it is not a 'good' and 'simple' server code. That's why I started changing the code.
</p>
<p>
Now it's in a private repository but someday I will release the code and write an article about it.
</p>
<p>
I wish that it could be a big motivation to me, again. Haha.
