<p>
I made this blog after the time I had got some small failures.
</p>
<p>
I got some lessons from those failures, two of those are;
<ol>
<li>I should develop my skill</li>
<li>I should record who I am, what I think, and what I made - to the internet.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
So...I would like to write posts about Game programming - especially network and server programming - and Game development.
</p>
<p>
I wish that it could be a big motivation to me.
